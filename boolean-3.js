/* You need to implement two functions, xor and or, that replicate the behaviour of their respective operators:

    xor = Takes 2 values and returns true if, and only if, one of them is truthy.
    or = Takes 2 values and returns true if either one of them is truthy.
    When doing so, you cannot use the or operator: ||.

Input
Not all input will be booleans - there will be truthy and falsy values [the latter including also empty strings and empty arrays]
There will always be 2 values provided
